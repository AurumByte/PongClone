# PongClone
A simple Pong clone made using SypherEngine v0.3.2

> This Game is intended to be a showcase 

### Controls
 - Click on the screen or press Spacebar to start playing.
 - Arrow Keys or WASD to move your paddle (on the left).

## Running the Game
Since SypherEngine hasn't been added to Maven Central or JitPack yet, you have to manually download the source, attach the `SypherEngine-v0.3.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar` to the project and run `Main.java`

### Since you're here, why not take a look at [SypherEngine](https://github.com/SypherEngine/SypherEngine) too?

> Note: There's a special ~~bug~~ feature in the game, that makes the bot a tad bit harder to beat, but its fiiiiinnneee
